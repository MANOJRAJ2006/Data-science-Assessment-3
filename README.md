“Gender-Based Voice Recognition using Unsupervised Machine Learning”

🎤 Gender-Based Voice Recognition using Unsupervised Machine Learning

This project uses audio processing and unsupervised learning techniques to classify voices based on gender using the *Librosa* library.

---

🚀 Features

- Voice signal processing with Librosa
- Feature extraction (MFCC, Chroma, etc.)
- Clustering using KMeans / GMM
- Accuracy evaluation using manual labeling

---

📚 Libraries Used

- Python
- Librosa
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

---

🛠️ Installation

bash
pip install librosa scikit-learn numpy matplotlib


---

🧪 How to Run

1. Collect `.wav` voice samples (male/female)
2. Preprocess and extract features using Librosa
3. Run the clustering model
4. Visualize and evaluate the results
